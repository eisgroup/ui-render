# UI Renderer

## Overview

The UI Renderer is a declarative dynamic [React](https://reactjs.org/) component that is capable of rendering almost any user interface, in any platform (web, mobile, desktop, etc.).

User can interact with the generated UI as if it's a normal web page (or scene view in mobile apps): click/touch on links, select from dropdowns, submit forms, etc.

It works by receiving two configuration files:
- [data.json](#datajson): contains data for all values displayed in the UI (text, label, input, etc.)
- [meta.json](#metajson): contains UI configuration on how to render the data visually (Button, Table, Pie chart, etc.)
